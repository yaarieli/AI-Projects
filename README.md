# AI-Projects
Just fun projects to practice using AI coding


Here is how I did it (but everything is an option):

1. Find a public API that does something cool.
2. Let your favorite AI Co-pilot built you three pages:
    - HTML
    - JavaScript
    - Css (In the description tell it to do something cool)
3. There you go!

# Bonus
Add a minor free backend that counts how many people dropped by to see what you did
